					CHAPTER I.<br>The Period
				</h2>
				<p>
					It was the (LUGONES, 1978) best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of
					wisdom, it was the age of <span class="footnote footnote1">foolishness</span>, it was the epoch of belief, it was
					the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season
					of Darkness, <span class="reference reference-GAMA,2019">it was <em>the <span>spring</span> of hope</em> (GAMA, 2019)</span>, it was the winter of despair, we
					had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going
					direct to Heaven, <span class="footnote footnote2">we were <em>all</em> going</span> direct the other way—in short,
					the period was so far like the present period (GAMA, 2019), that some of its noisiest
					authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the
					superlative degree of comparison only.
				</p>
				<p>
					There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the
					throne of England; there were a king with (LEON, 2006) a large jaw and a queen with a
					fair face (LEON, 2006), on the throne of France (LUGONES, 1978). In both countries it was clearer than
					crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that
					things in general were settled for ever.
				</p>
				<p>
					It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.
					Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period, as
					at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth
					blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had
					heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were made
					for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane ghost
					had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its messages,
					as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally deficient in
					originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the earthly order of
					events had lately come to the English Crown and People, from a congress of
					British subjects in America: which, strange to relate, have proved more
					important to the human race than any communications yet received through
					any of the chickens of the Cock-lane brood.
				</p>
				<p>
					France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her sister
					of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down hill,
					making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her Christian
					pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane achievements
					as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue torn out with
					pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not kneeled down in the
					rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks which passed within his
					view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty yards. It is likely enough
					that, rooted in the woods of France and Norway, there were growing trees,
					when that sufferer was put to death, already marked by the Woodman, Fate,
					to come down and be sawn into boards, to make a certain movable framework
					with a sack and a knife in it, terrible in history. It is likely enough
					that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to
					Paris, there were sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts,
					bespattered with rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by
					poultry, which the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils
					of the Revolution. But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work
					unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about with
					muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion that
					they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.
				</p>
				<p>
					In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to
					justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and
					highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night; families
					were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their
					furniture to upholsterers’ warehouses for security; the highwayman in the
					dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and
					challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of
					“the Captain,” gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the mail
					was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and then got
					shot dead himself by the other four, “in consequence of the failure of his
					ammunition:” after which the mail was robbed in peace; that magnificent
					potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand and deliver on
					Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the illustrious creature
					in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London gaols fought battles with
					their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law fired blunderbusses in among
					them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball; thieves snipped off diamond
					crosses from the necks of noble lords at Court drawing-rooms; musketeers
					went into St. Giles’s, to search for contraband goods, and the mob fired
					on the musketeers, and the musketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought
					any of these occurrences much out of the common way. In the midst of them,
					the hangman, ever busy and ever worse than useless, was in constant
					requisition; now, stringing up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now,
					hanging a housebreaker on Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now,
					burning people in the hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning
					pamphlets at the door of Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an
					atrocious murderer, and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a
					farmer’s boy of sixpence.
				</p>
				<p>
					All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close upon
					the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. Environed
					by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded, those two of
					the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the fair faces, trod
					with stir enough, and carried their divine rights with a high hand. Thus
					did the year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five conduct their
					Greatnesses, and myriads of small creatures—the creatures of this
					chronicle among the rest—along the roads that lay before them.

However, it is known that pursuing such deeds are complex systemic challenges that many times are not taken forward. On this subject, it is worth mentioning the case of Brazil, whose government was one of the countries who signed the Leaders' Declaration on Forests and Land Us on the 12th of November of 2021, committing to reduce drastically deforestation in the country and contain 30% of methane emissions by 2030 (information retrieved from https://ukcop26.org/glasgow-leaders-declaration-on-forests-and-land-use/, accessed on 18.12.2021) . However,  Brazilian leadership has not put forward relevant measures that support this objective. As Brazilian’s Government representatives announce the program “Floresta+”, official data from Deter (the country’s platform for measuring the Amazon Forest’s coverage) shows that, over the last two years under their watch, deforestation on the Amazon has grown immensely compared to previous years."
